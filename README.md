A world full of strange and brutal phenomena and catastrophes!

Time is distorting, today can become tomorrow, or even yesterday. A freezing cold forces you to stay near fire. A radiant sky burns the lands. An array of Lightning threatens those without shelter.

Your actions have consequences and contract curses. These might make your food try to eat you, or cause your attacks to misfire.
Over time, your terror will grow. You will hear voices, become paralysed, and be assaulted by ever increasing packs of mobs.

The horrific whispers will reveal secrets to you. Use your secrets, to perform powerful rites to multiply your resources, remove your curses, or even save yourself from death.
